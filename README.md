Kruskal
=======

This is an implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of an undirected, weighted graph.

Code is written in *Scala*, using SBT to load dependencies for unit testing.

- Graph: uses two arrays to build an adjacency matrix
- UnionFind: uses multiple sets to solve problem, no tree balancing and other optimizations

For documentation of functionality take a look at the unit tests.

Run via SBT:

- run: runs Demo
- test: runs tests
