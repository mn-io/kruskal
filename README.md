Kruskal
=======

This is a implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning tree of an undirected, weighted graph

Code is written in *Scala*, using SBT to load dependencies for unit tests.

- Graph: uses two arrays to build an adjacency matrix
- UnionFind: uses multiple sets to solve problem, no tree balancing and other optimizations

For documentation of functionality take a look at unit tests

Run via SBT:

- run: runs Demo
- test: runs tests
